                <p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-bottom: 40px; color: var(--text-muted);">A retro-style terminal
                    interface built as my portfolio website. Inspired by the game Alien: Isolation.</p>

                <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin-bottom: 40px;">

                <p>Before this website, my portfolio looked a bit different. At the time I was playing through a game
                    called Alien: Isolation on my Xbox 360. It’s set between the first two Alien movies in the franchise
                    focusing on Ripley’s daughter coming across the notorious ‘Alien’ herself.
                    <br><br>
                    The game has these computer terminals placed around the spaceship where you can access ship
                    functions such as doors and read messages to give you any clues. These terminals have a striking and
                    unique retro-futuristic vibe. It immediately caught my eye and I got to work on recreating this
                    design as my website.
                </p>

                <img src="images/sevastopolreal.webp" alt="Sevastopol Interface" width="700" height="450">

                <p>I wanted to build a fully interactive portfolio website styled like a Sevastolink terminal:
                    <br><br>
                    - CRT aesthetic<br>
                    - Scanlines overlay<br>
                    - Green monochrome theme<br>
                    - Folder navigation with connector lines<br>
                    - Dynamic content panels<br>
                    - A Pong game (because why not?)
                    <br><br>
                    The idea wasn’t to copy the interface exactly, but to replicate the feeling of it.
                    <br><br>
                    Each folder button dynamically calculates its vertical connector line length based on its layout
                    position. When switching folders or entering fullscreen mode, it recalculates the line height to
                    keep everything properly aligned.
                    <br><br>
                    To simulate the screen effect, the entire UI sits beneath a scanlines PNG overlay. A bezel image
                    frames the display, and <codeinline>z-index</codeinline> layering is carefully controlled
                    throughout. <codeinline>pointer-events: none</codeinline> is used so the overlays don’t block
                    interaction. These small details make everything feel like it’s being rendered inside a physical
                    monitor.
                </p>

                <div class="blog-image-row">
                    <img src="images/loading.png" alt="Sevastopol Loading Screen">
                    <img src="images/aboutme.png" alt="Sevastopol About Me">
                </div>

                <p>Next, to match the industrial sci-fi feel of the interface, I used a pixel-style font (Retro
                    Computer).
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, I embedded a fully working Pong game built with the <codeinline>canvas</codeinline> API. It
                    includes dynamic resizing, CPU paddle AI, collision detection, and real-time rendering using
                    <codeinline>requestAnimationFrame</codeinline>. It felt fitting to include an old-school arcade game
                    inside a retro terminal interface.
                </p>

                <img src="images/pong.png" alt="Sevastopol Pong Game" width="700" height="450">
                <p>Some suprisingly tricky things were keeping connector lines aligned when resizing/fullscreen and
                    making the Pong canvas perfectly fill the terminal window. Most of the time wasn’t spent writing
                    logic, it was actually spent adjusting 0.2vw borders and aligning elements by eye until it felt
                    right. <br><br>
                    This wasn’t just a UI replication project. It was an exercise in attention to detail and turning
                    nostalgia into implementation.
                    Rebuilding something you admire forces you to understand it deeply. And in this case, it was just as
                    satisfying as playing through the game itself.
