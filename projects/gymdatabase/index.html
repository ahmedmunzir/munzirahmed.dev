                <div class="post-date">20.12.24</div>
                <p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-bottom: 40px; color: var(--text-muted);">A fully designed and
                    implemented relational database system for managing members, subscriptions, bookings and staff
                    operations. Built as part of a university group project, the system includes
                    entity-relationship modelling, normalization, constraints, and SQL queries.</p>
                <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin-bottom: 40px;">

                <p>For one of my university group projects we built a fully working Gym Management System database using
                    Oracle APEX. The goal was simple. Design a realistic system that could actually run a gym. Not just
                    store names and numbers but handle memberships, bookings, personal training sessions, discounts,
                    attendance and more.<br><br>
                    <img src="images/GMS-USECASE.png" alt="Gym Management System Use Case Diagram" width="700"
                        height="600">
                    We started with the design. Before writing a single line of SQL we identified all the strong and
                    weak entities. Members, Staff, Membership Plans, Classes, Workouts, Class Bookings,
                    Guests.
                </p>


                <p>Then we built a full ERD and carefully defined the relationships between everything. Every foreign
                    key had a purpose. Every table had a reason to exist. That part taught me how important structure is
                    before implementation.</p>

                <img src="images/Gym-ERD.png" alt="Gym Entity Relationship Diagram" width="700" height="400">
                <p>After that we mapped the ERD into a fully normalised relational model. Everything was brought into
                    Third Normal Form. No transitive dependencies. No attributes depending on non key columns. Just
                    clean structure and clarity.<br><br>

                    Then came the SQL. We wrote DDL scripts for over fifteen tables including Member, Staff, PT Session,
                    Attendance, Discount Usage and more. Primary keys were defined properly. Foreign key constraints
                    were added using alter table so referential integrity was enforced across the entire system.</p>

                <div class="sql-container">
                    <div class="sql-snippet">
                        <pre>CREATE TABLE Staff (
    StaffID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    First_Name VARCHAR2(100),
    Last_Name VARCHAR2(100),
    DOB DATE,
    Gender VARCHAR2(10),
    Salary NUMBER,
    Phone_No VARCHAR2(20),
    Email VARCHAR2(100),
    Specialisation VARCHAR2(100)
);</pre>
                    </div>
                    <div class="sql-snippet">
                        <pre>CREATE TABLE Member (
    MemberID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    First_Name VARCHAR2(100),
    Last_Name VARCHAR2(100),
    DOB DATE,
    Gender VARCHAR2(10),
    Address VARCHAR2(255),
    Phone_No VARCHAR2(20),
    Email VARCHAR2(100),
    PlanID NUMBER
);</pre>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Populating the database required planning as well. We inserted into independent tables first such as
                    Equipment and Discounts. Then we populated the dependent tables once foreign key references existed.
                    That order mattered. It prevented constraint errors and forced us to think logically about data
                    flow.<br><br>

                    The most interesting part for me was writing analytical queries. We created queries to list all
                    classes with instructors, calculate monthly revenue across memberships and bookings, identify the
                    top trainers by session count, and even detect members whose memberships expired but were still
                    attending the gym. That is when the database started to feel real. It stopped being tables and
                    started being insight.</p>

                <div class="sql-container">
                    <div class="sql-snippet">
                        <pre>SELECT
    SUM(m.FEE) AS Membership_Revenue,
    SUM(pt.FEE) AS PT_Session_Revenue,
    SUM(cb.FEE) AS Class_Booking_Revenue,
    (SUM(m.FEE) + SUM(pt.FEE) + SUM(cb.FEE)) AS Total_Revenue
FROM
    MEMBERSHIP m
LEFT JOIN PT_SESSION pt ON pt.MEMBERID = m.PLANID
LEFT JOIN CLASSBOOKING cb ON cb.MEMBERID = m.PLANID
WHERE
    TO_CHAR(m.EXPIRYDATE, 'MM-YYYY') = '12-2024'
    OR TO_CHAR(pt.SESSIONDATE, 'MM-YYYY') = '12-2024'
    OR TO_CHAR(cb.BOOKINGDATE, 'MM-YYYY') = '12-2024';</pre>
                    </div>
                    <div class="sql-snippet">
                        <pre>SELECT
    m.FIRST_NAME || ' ' || m.LAST_NAME AS Member_Name,
    m.EMAIL,
    m.PHONE_NO,
    mem.EXPIRYDATE,
    a.ATTENDANCEDATE
FROM
    MEMBER m
INNER JOIN
    MEMBERSHIP mem ON m.PLANID = mem.PLANID
INNER JOIN
    ATTENDANCE a ON a.MEMBERID = m.MEMBERID
WHERE
    mem.EXPIRYDATE < SYSDATE
    AND a.ATTENDANCEDATE BETWEEN SYSDATE - 30 AND SYSDATE;</pre>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>We also implemented triggers to automate business logic. Membership status automatically changes to
                    inactive once expired. Class capacity decreases when someone books a spot. Members can be notified
                    before expiry. That was the point where it moved beyond basic CRUD and into automation.<br><br>

                    Looking back, this project forced me to think like a systems designer. Not just writing code but
                    designing rules, enforcing integrity, and thinking about how data behaves in the real world. We also
                    discussed security considerations and how a system like this would need encryption and stronger
                    protection if deployed in production.<br><br>

                    It was a proper foundational database project. Structured. Logical. Clean.

                    And honestly it made me appreciate backend systems more than ever.</p>
