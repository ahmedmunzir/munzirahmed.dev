                <p class="post-excerpt" style="margin-bottom: 40px; color: var(--text-muted);">How a used Dell Optiplex
                    3080 off Facebook Marketplace became my home server
                    and my new toy.</p>

                <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #333; margin-bottom: 40px;">

                <p>It’s been just over 30 days since I built and installed my own home server, and I can confidently say
                    the journey so far has been a valuable hands-on learning experience.</p>

                <p>I started with purchasing a used Mini-PC off Facebook Marketplace. This decision has proven to be a
                    cost-effective way to get into self-hosting without breaking the bank.

                </p>

                <p>Storage was my first lesson. Due to the Dell Optiplex Micros small form factor, the system only
                    supports a single 2.5” drive. High-capacity 2.5” drives are increasingly scarce and, in many cases,
                    not brand new, which can impact reliability. This made it clear that when I eventually migrate to a
                    server with a larger chassis, I’ll be able to install multiple 3.5” drives and experiment with RAID
                    technologies, trading some capacity for redundancy to protect data in the event of a drive failure.
                </p>

                <p>Next, it was time to purchase the right accessories. A Netgear switch and a Cat 6 Ethernet cable
                    ensures the server has stable and consistent network connectivity. I then upgraded the system with a
                    2TB SSD for my OS. I opted for Proxmox which is a hypervisor that allows for deployment and
                    management of virtual machines and containers. </p>

                <p>From there I spent time working with:
                <ul>
                    <li>File systems, datasets, and permissions</li>
                    <li>Media libraries and streaming via Jellyfin</li>
                    <li>Managing storage and access through TrueNAS</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>Along the way, I’ve had to think properly about bottlenecks, trade-offs, and scalability. Things
                    rarely fit into place as you want it, and every issue turns into a learning opportunity.</p>

                <p>Recently, I’ve expanded the RAM from 16GB to 32GB, which now gives me the headroom to focus more
                    on
                    cybersecurity projects, such as multiple lab environments and security analysis tools without

                <p>My setup isn’t perfect but it’s given me a much deeper understanding of infrastructure, systems
                    design, and how different components interact in real-world environments. I’m excited to keep
                    iterating on this lab and pushing it further.</p>
